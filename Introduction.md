# OpenVAS: Vulnerability Scanning and Management Tool

 Overview

OpenVAS (Open Vulnerability Assessment System) is an open-source vulnerability scanner and vulnerability management solution used by security professionals, pentesters, and system administrators to assess the security posture of systems and networks. It is part of the Greenbone Vulnerability Management (GVM) suite, which provides a powerful platform for identifying and managing vulnerabilities in IT infrastructure.

What is OpenVAS?
  
OpenVAS is designed to scan systems for known vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and security weaknesses by using a comprehensive and regularly updated database of Network Vulnerability Tests (NVTs). These tests cover a wide range of systems and software, including operating systems, network devices, and web applications. By conducting detailed scans, OpenVAS can help identify exploitable vulnerabilities and security gaps, providing critical information to improve the overall security posture of the network.

Why is OpenVAS Important for Pentesters?
  
As a pentester, OpenVAS serves as an essential tool for:

* Network Scanning: It helps identify open ports, active services, and potential entry points that might be vulnerable to attacks.

* Vulnerability Detection: OpenVAS compares the target system’s software versions and configurations against its extensive NVT database, flagging known vulnerabilities (e.g., missing patches, misconfigured services, outdated software).

* Compliance Checks: It can be used to validate the compliance of systems against security standards such as PCI-DSS, CIS benchmarks, and other best practices.

* Reporting: OpenVAS generates detailed reports that categorize vulnerabilities by severity (e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Low) and provide actionable recommendations, making it easier for pentesters to communicate findings to stakeholders.

How Does OpenVAS Work?

OpenVAS operates by running scans against specified targets, which can be individual systems, entire networks, or specific IP ranges. It uses different scanning profiles:

* Full and Fast: A comprehensive scan that balances thoroughness with speed.

* Full and Very Deep: A more intensive scan designed for deep analysis of all services and ports.

* Host Discovery: A lightweight scan for quickly identifying active hosts on the network.

Scans can be authenticated or unauthenticated:

- Unauthenticated Scans: These scans probe the target externally, simulating the perspective of an attacker without legitimate credentials.

- Authenticated Scans: By using valid credentials (e.g., SSH for Linux or SMB for Windows), OpenVAS can perform deeper analysis, checking for misconfigurations and missing patches at the system level.

Advantages of Using OpenVAS

* Free and Open-Source: OpenVAS is available under a free license, making it accessible for pentesters and organizations regardless of budget constraints.

* Regularly Updated NVT Database: The tool maintains an up-to-date database, ensuring scans are comprehensive and aligned with the latest threat intelligence.

* Customizability: Users can create custom scan configurations and policies, adapting OpenVAS to specific environments or security requirements.

* Integration Capabilities: OpenVAS can be integrated with other tools in the pentesting ecosystem (e.g., Metasploit, Nessus) to enhance the depth and accuracy of vulnerability assessments.

When to Use OpenVAS?

OpenVAS is ideal for:

* Initial Network Scanning: At the beginning of a pentest to gather information about the target environment and identify high-risk vulnerabilities quickly.

* Regular Vulnerability Assessments: Periodic scans help monitor the security status of an environment and ensure that vulnerabilities are addressed over time.

* Compliance Audits: OpenVAS can be configured to run scans that align with compliance frameworks, helping organizations meet regulatory requirements.

Conclusion

OpenVAS is a versatile and robust tool for pentesters and security professionals seeking to perform thorough and effective vulnerability assessments. Its open-source nature, coupled with a wide range of scanning capabilities and extensive reporting features, makes it an essential asset in the pentester’s toolkit.
